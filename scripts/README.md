This directory provides sample CTF scripts for testing and reference. The scripts can be executed after activating the CTF environment by running
`ctf scripts/` from the CTF repository.

The `sample_editor_workspace.json` can be loaded by the CTF editor to view/run the scripts within this directory.

###### Note - The `sample_editor_workspace.json` assumes a `sample_cfs_workspace` in the user's home directory. If that is not the case, please update the `ccddJsonDir` field.
