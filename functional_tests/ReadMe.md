This directory provides sample CTF scripts for testing and reference. After activating the CTF environment, the scripts can be executed  by running
`ctf --config_file vv_tests/configs/ctf_vv_config.ini ./functional_tests/Test_StartCfsEnableOutput.json ./functional_tests/plugin_tests ./functional_tests/cfe_6_7_tests` from the CTF repository.
